### Project Overview
This project aims to analyze content categories on the Social Buzz platform to identify the most popular topics and understand user preferences. 

### Data Analysis Process

1. **Data Acquisition:**
   * Collected relevant datasets: `Reactions`, `Content`, and `ReactionTypes`.

2. **Data Cleaning:**
   * Removed rows with missing values to ensure data integrity.

3. **Data Merging:**
   * Combined the datasets to comprehensively view user interactions and content performance.

4. **Data Analysis:**
   * Identified top content categories based on popularity scores.
   * Analyzed the distribution of content categories.
   * Identified seasonal trends in content creation.

### Key Findings

* **Top 5 Categories:** Animals, Science, Healthy Eating, Food, and Technology.
* **Category Popularity:** The "Animals" category emerged as the most popular.
* **Unique Categories:** A total of 16 unique categories were identified.
